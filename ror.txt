# or

# yield keyword in ruby******************************************************************************

# used to stop execution of a method and call a block first
# When a method contains yield, it pauses at that point, and the block of code passed to it is executed. After the block finishes, the method continues running.

# o/p ->  Hello mere bahi    1st its print and then stop execution and block execution is start and then method continue 
# kaisa hai tu
# bro how are you



# Procs*********************************************************************************************

# A proc is like a block, but it's an object, so you can save it to a variable and reuse it.
# You can pass a proc to a method as an argument.
# Procs are created using Proc.new or the proc method.



# my_proc = Proc.new {puts "Hello from proc"}   # Here capital P is there 

# my_proc.call                    #.call used to call proc , block and lambda           # output Hello from proc


# my_proc = proc {puts "Hello from proc"}           # Here small p is there

# my_proc.call                  # output hello from proc



# def greet(prroc)
    
#      prroc.call
# end

# greet(my_Proc)

# output
# "Hello from proc
# Hello from proc



# procs with different ways

# my_Proc = proc {|name| puts "Hello baby my name is #{name}"}

# my_Proc.call("varun")
# my_Proc.call("Chirag")




# Difference between blocks and procs *********************************************

# Blocks: Simple, can't be stored, and only one per method.
# Procs: Flexible, can be stored in variables, and passed as many times as needed.


# how we can pass block as an argument

#     def greet(name , &block)       #&block reserve keyword used to take block as an argument

#                                # block passed in a method or not
#             block.call(name)   # its calls the block which is initialize below
#         else
            
#            puts "Hello from greet"
#        end
# end        
    
# end

# greettt = Greetings.new

# greettt.greet("Alice") do |name|       # here we are calling greet method with name and object both 
    
# puts "Hello brother my name is #{name}"
    
# end

# greettt.greet("bob")    # here we calling greet only with name


# output
# Hello from Alice
# Hello brther my name is Alice
# Hello from bob
# Hello from greet


# 2nd way of passing block inside a method 

# class Parent
#   def process(&block)
#     block.call if block_given?
#   end
# end

#   def process(&block)
#     puts "Processing in Child"

# child.process { puts "Processing in Block" }


# output

# Processing in Block




# Lamdbas *****************************************************************************************

# When it comes to encapsulating code into reusable units, lambdas are similar to procs.
#  However, in terms of behavior and syntax, they do differ slightly from one another.
# The main difference lies in argument handling and return statements.


# What are lambdas?
# Lambdas are anonymous functions that can be assigned to variables or passed as arguments.
#  The lambda keyword or the -> syntax is used to define lambdas in Ruby, and behave like methods. 
#  They can be considered as an advanced version of procs.



# my_lambda = lambda { |x, y| puts x+y}  #using lambda keyword

# my_lambda = ->(x , y) {puts x + y}    #using -> syntax



# The main difference between lambdas and procs lies in how they handle return statements and argument checking.
# Lambdas perform argument checking, ensuring that correct number of arguments are passed.
# Additionally, lambdas return control to the calling method, whereas procs return immediately, bypassing the calling method


# difference between proc and lambda

# Procs: return exits both the Proc and the method that called it.
# Lambdas: return exits only the lambda, allowing the method that called the lambda to continue executing.


# proc example 

# def proc_example
#   my_proc = Proc.new do
#     puts "Inside Proc"
#     return "Returning from Proc"
#   end
  
#   result = my_proc.call
#   puts "This line will not be executed."    # because return inside proc return immediately that's why method ends its execution
#   return result
# end

# puts proc_example

# output
# Inside Proc
# Returning from Proc

# lambda example 


# def lammm
    
#     my_lambda = lambda do 
        
#         puts "HEllo bro from lambda"
        
#         return "return from lambda"
#     end
    
    
#     result = my_lambda.call
    
#     puts "this line is executed"   # here it work because return inside lambda didn't return immediately it's return statement didn't stop execution of method it's stop execution of only lambda
    
#     return result
# end

# puts lammm

# output
# HEllo bro from lambda
# this line is executed
# return from lambda




# increment_and_double = ->(num) { (num+1) *2}

# result = increment_and_double.call(5)
# puts "Result = #{result}"


# Notes for procs and lambdas


# Conclusion

# Ruby provides a means to organize statements into blocks of code that can be performed and supplied
#  to functions.

# It is possible to save, call, and send code blocks as parameters to methods by enclosing 
# them in objects called procs in Ruby.

# Using the call method, procs can be called and reused because they can be assigned to variables, 
# making them callable.

# Procs can be supplied to methods as arguments, giving a mechanism to transmit both behavior
#  and data and increasing the flexibility of the code.

# Although lambdas and procs are similar, they differ slightly in their syntax and behavior,
#  including strict parameter checking and method-like return statements.

# Closures, including lambdas and procs, can return values to the calling context using the 
# return keyword, facilitating data exchange between closures and their callers.




# closures*************************************************************************************

# so yield call backs to greeter function and pass greeting  


# Block(Closure): The block { |greet| puts greet + ", World!" } is a closure because it captures 
# the greeting variable from the method's scope and can use it when executed.
 
# def greeter
     
# greeting = "hello"
# yield(greeting)

# end

# greeter do |greet|
# puts greet + ", World!"
# end

# output
# Hello world



# def create_closure
     
# message = "Hello from create closure"

# proc = Proc.new do              # a new proc object which is a closure is created . This proc capture the message variable
#     puts message
# end


# return proc
# end

# create_closure.call

# Output : Hello from create closure

# Closures are blocks, procs, or lambdas that capture the variables from their surrounding context
# (the environment where they were defined).


# They allow you to "freeze" the environment and use it later, even if the environment 
# where the closure was created no longer exists.

# end

# Webkorps.greet

# Output:

# self is class method when you use self in a class self refer to the class not an instance of a class

# class Webkorps
    
#     def self.discreate           # it's a class method or we can say it's a singleton method 
        
#         puts "Hello from class self #{self}"
#     end
    
# end


# Webkorps.discreate     # it shows the output i.e. Helllo from class self Webkorps




# self used to access instance variable 

# class Webkorps
    
#     def initialize(name)
#         self.name = name                # here self.name= name calling a setter method i.e. name=

#    end
# end

# web = Webkorps.new("chirag")

# self one more e.g

# class Example
#     def self.func
#         puts self.class # Output: class
#     end
# end
  
# Example.func


# an if you see this

# class Example
#     def func
#         puts self.class # Output: Example

# example = Example.new
# example.func



# self Inside of a Class or Module Definition********************************************************

# Within a class or module definition, self refers to the class or module itself.
#  It allows us to define methods and access class-level variables directly 
#  without the need for a method call.

# No need for method or class call 

# module Webkorps
    
#     puts self       # output Webkorps
    
#     class Employee
#         puts self       #  output Webkorps :: Employee
#     end
    
# end



# Summary:

# self in Instance Methods: Refers to the instance of the class that called the method.
# self in Class Methods: Refers to the class itself.
# Using self to Define Class Methods: You can define a class method using self.method_name.
# Using self to Access Instance Variables: Allows you to call instance methods like setters 
# within other instance methods.




# conclusion
# The self variable in Ruby refers to the current object and its behavior depends on the context.

# In a class method, self refers to the class itself. It can be used to define class-level variables
# #  or methods.

# In an instance method, self refers to the instance of the class on which the process is called.
#  It allows accessing and modifying instance-specific data.

# Within a class or module definition, self refers to the class or module itself.
#  It is used to define class/module-level methods and variables.


# Singleton method **********************************************************************************

# we can create only one function threw one object that why it's name is a singleton method

# class Webkorps 
#     puts "Hello #{self}"
#     end
    
#     w1 = Webkorps.new
     
#    def w1.func                 # here we are creating threw object memory address 
       
#        puts "hello #{self}"
#    end
   
   
#    w1.func

#   output
# Hello Webkorps
# hello #<Webkorps:0x000064904e064080>       this is object memory address which tells that object is of webkorps class and after that hexadecimal memmory address



# one more way to create singleton method 

# You can also define a singleton method directly on the class itself. This method will only be 
# available on the class object itself, not on instances of the class.


# class MyClass
# end

# def MyClass.singleton_class_method                  # here we create singleton method inside class
#   "I'm a class method"
# end

# puts MyClass.singleton_class_method # => "I'm a class method"


# Notes 
# we can create more than one singleton method threw single object

# conclusion

# In a singleton method, self refers to the singleton object on which the method is defined.
#  Singleton methods are defined on specific instances rather than on the class itself.
# Understanding the different contexts of self is crucial for writing clean and efficient Ruby code 
# as it enables proper utilization of object-oriented concepts and encapsulation.
# By using self-effectively, developers can manipulate and access data at the appropriate level of 
# abstraction, resulting in more maintainable and organized code.

# regualar expression ********************************************************************************

# Regular Expressions are used for matching patterns within strings.

# Ruby provides a powerful set of tools to create and use regex.

# Common methods: =~, .match, .gsub, .scan, etc.

# Application in RoR: Often used in validations, text processing, and data extraction.



# if "hello world" =~ /world/
    
#     puts "found"
    
# else 
#     puts "not found"
# end

# output found


# for case sensitive 

# if "hello World" =~ /world/i
    
#     puts "found"
    
# else 
#     puts "not found"
# end

# found


# matching email formate 

# email = "chirag@gmail.com"

# if email =~ /\A[\w+\-.]+@[a-z\d\-.]+\.[a-z]+\z/i
    
#     print "match with email formate"
#     puts
    
# else 
#     puts "not match with email formate"
    
# end



# gsub!  used to replce text

# text = "I love dhruvi"

# text.gsub!("dhruvi" , "anushka")

# puts text



# one more ways of using regular expressin i.e. regex


# (\d+) captures a sequence of digits, and $1 refers to the first captured group (in this case, "123")

# price = "price : $12345"

# if price =~ /price : \$(\d+)/
    
#     puts "the price is #{$1}"       
# end


# output the price is 12345


# scan method

# text = "Cats are cute. Cats are fun."
# matches = text.scan(/Cats/)

# puts matches.inspect  # Outputs: ["Cats", "Cats"]



# Multi threading**************************************************************************************



# Multithreading is a crucial concept in programming that enables the execution of multiple tasks
# concurrently, thereby improving the performance and responsiveness of applications.
# In Ruby, the Thread class provides native support for multithreading,
# allowing developers to leverage the benefits of parallel execution.
# This article aims to delve into the effective usage of Ruby threads,
# providing insights into their creation, termination, lifecycle, exception handling,
# and various other aspects.

# Developers can use Ruby threads to build applications that can handle multiple tasks simultaneously. 
# This is particularly advantageous for tasks that require significant computational power, 
# involve I/O operations, or benefit from concurrent execution for improved performance. 
# Ruby threads provide a higher-level abstraction, making it easier to implement concurrent 
# behaviour and simplifying the development of multi-threaded programs.


# e.g. 1

# thread = Thread.new do                 # thread.new keyword is used to create thread
#     puts "helllo woldsdgsdf"
# end


# thread.join                           # join keyword is generally used to access thread


# e.g.2

# th1 = Thread.new do 
#     puts "From th1"
# end

# th2 = Thread.new do
#     puts "From th2"
# end

# th1.join
# th2.join

# output  From th1
        # From th2




# Terminating ruby thread 
# Threads in Ruby are terminated automatically when the code within the thread block completes.
#  However, there might be cases where you need to explicitly terminate a thread.
#   The Thread#kill method can be used to forcefully terminate a thread.

# e.g.3

# thread = Thread.new do 
#    puts "hello world"
#    end


# thread.kill
# thread.join
# output   #              -> blank because we kill the thread now after that no sense of join




# Thread Lifecycle


# The lifecycle of a Ruby thread involves the creation, execution, and termination stages.
# During creation, a thread is instantiated using Thread.new and enters the runnable state.
# In the execution stage, the thread actively runs and performs tasks concurrently with other threads.
# It can be paused using Thread#sleep and resumed later. Finally, the thread terminates either 
# by completing its execution or being explicitly terminated using Thread#kill. 
# Managing the thread lifecycle requires synchronization and proper resource management 
# for the stability and integrity of the application.


# Threads and Exceptions

# Thread.abort_on_exception = true    
# If you have a multi-threaded application where a failure in any thread indicates a serious problem 
# that should cause the entire program to halt, setting abort_on_exception to true ensures that such 
# failures are not silently ignored. It forces the application to stop,
#  which might be necessary if the error in one thread compromises the integrity of the
#   entire application.



# Thread.abort_on_exception = true              #

# th = Thread.new do
#     # Thread code goes here
#     raise "Exception raised"
# end

# # ...

# begin
#     th.join
# rescue => e
#     puts "Exception caught: #{e.message}"
# end

# Output => Exception caught: Exception raised




# Thread Pools


# Thread Pool is an abstraction that allows us to assign a task to a pool of threads,
# where one of the available threads will execute the task. Thread pools are beneficial in scenarios
# where the overhead of creating and destroying threads is a concern. By creating a pool of reusable 
# worker threads and reusing them for different tasks, the performance of long-running applications, 
# such as services, can be significantly improved.

# The concurrent-ruby gem provides higher-level abstractions in addition to thread pools.
# Thread pools are referred to as 'executors'. An executor is an object that can accept a unit of
# work and execute it. Thread pools are the primary type of executor we will encounter, with other
# types primarily used for testing or unusual edge cases.

# Here is an example of using a thread pool executor:


# require 'concurrent'

# th_pool = Concurrent::ThreadPoolExecutor.new(min_threads: 5, max_threads: 5)

# 5.times do |i|
#     th_pool.post do
#         puts "Task #{i} executed by thread #{Thread.current.object_id}"
#     end
# end

# th_pool.shutdown
# th_pool.wait_for_termination




# Thread Variables

# Ruby threads have thread-local variables that can be used to store and access data specific
# to each thread. Thread-local variables are isolated and not shared among threads.
# To define and access thread-local variables, we can use the Thread.current object.


# th = Thread.new do
#     Thread.current[:greet] = "Hello"
#     puts Thread.current[:greet]
# end

# th.join        # output hello



# Thread priority


# Ruby threads have a concept of priority that can be used to influence their scheduling. 
# The default thread priority is 0. Higher-priority threads are given preference by the Ruby 
# interpreter during scheduling. To set the priority of a thread, 
# we can use the Thread#priority= method.

# Here's an example:

# th = Thread.new do
#     # code
# end

# th.priority = 2




# Thread exclusion

# often referred to as mutual exclusion, is a concept used to prevent multiple threads 
# from accessing shared resources at the same time. This is important because if multiple threads 
# try to modify the same resource (like a variable or file) simultaneously, it can lead to 
# unpredictable results, such as data corruption or incorrect calculations.


# Imagine two threads trying to increment the same counter variable at the same time. 
# Without thread exclusion, both threads might read the current value of the counter at the same time, 
# increment it, and then write the new value back. If the initial value was 5, you might expect the 
# final value to be 7 after both threads run, but due to the race condition, the final value might 
# still be 6.


# require 'concurrent'

# mutex = Mutex.new
# counter = 0

# # Create a thread pool with 5 threads
# th_pool = Concurrent::ThreadPoolExecutor.new(min_threads: 5, max_threads: 5)

# 10.times do
#   th_pool.post do
#     mutex.synchronize do
#       # Only one thread can enter this block at a time
#       temp = counter
#       temp += 1
#       counter = temp
#     end
#   end
# end

# th_pool.shutdown
# th_pool.wait_for_termination

# puts "Final counter value: #{counter}"




# Handling Deadlock

# Deadlock is a situation where two or more threads are blocked indefinitely, waiting for each other 
# to release resources. Deadlocks can occur when threads acquire locks in different orders, 
# leading to a circular dependency. To avoid deadlocks, it's essential to carefully design our 
# multithreaded code and ensure that locks are acquired in a consistent order.

# Here are some general guidelines to prevent deadlocks:

# Always acquire locks in the same order across all threads.
# Use timeouts when acquiring locks to prevent indefinite waiting.
# Use thread-safe data structures and libraries to minimize the need for manual synchronization




# Module and Mixins***********************************************************************************


# What is a Module?
# A module in Ruby is a collection of methods, constants, and other module or class definitions. 
# Modules are similar to classes, but they cannot be instantiated (you can't create objects from them).
# They are mainly used to group related methods together and to share code between classes.



# What is a Mixin?

# A mixin is a way to add functionality from a module to a class. When a module is included in a 
# class, the methods from the module become available as instance methods of that class. 
# This is the essence of a mixin in Ruby.


# Inculding a module

# When you include a module in a class, the methods defined in the module become instance methods 
# of the class. This means that objects (instances) of the class can use those methods.


# module Parent
    
#     puts "Hello from parent"
    
#     def Child
#         puts "helllo from child"
#     end
    
# end

# class Child2
        
#    include Parent   
#    puts "hello"

# end
    

# children = Child2.new

# children.Child

# output
# Hello from parent
# hello
# helllo from child



# extending a module in mixins

# When you extend a module in a class, the methods defined in the module become class methods of that 
# class. This means you can call those methods directly on the class itself, rather than on an 
# instance of the class.


# module Parent
    
#     puts "Hello from parent"
    
#     def Child
#         puts "helllo from child"
#     end
    
# end

#     class Child2
        
#         extend Parent
        
#         puts "hello"
#     end
    


# Child2.Child                   # in extend we don't need to create instance i.e. object of a class

# output
# Hello from parent
# hello
# helllo from child



# one more e.g

# module A
#   def hello
#     puts "Hello from module A!"
#   end
# end

# module B
#   def hello
#     puts "Hello from module B!"
#   end
# end

# class MyClass
#   include A
#   include B
# end

# obj = MyClass.new
# obj.hello                 # ouptput is Hello from module B!

# Since B was included after A, its hello method is found first.



# # What is a Hash?***********************************************************************************

# In Ruby and Ruby on Rails (RoR), a hash is a collection of key-value pairs, like a dictionary.
#  You use keys to look up values. It’s a bit like an address book where you can look up a person’s
#   address (the value) using their name (the key).





# Person = {
#         Name: "CHirag Agrawal",
#         City: "Chhindwara",
#         Age:  23
#     }
    
    
    # puts Person[:Name]
    
    # puts Person[:Age]
    
    # Person[:gender] = "Male"
    
    # puts Person[:gender]
    
    # puts Person.keys
    
    # puts Person.values
    
    
    # Person.each do |key , value|
    #     puts "keys : #{key} , values : #{value}"
    # end
    
    
    
    # Person.delete(:City)
    
    # puts Person[:City]               #output : blank
    
    
    
#     puts Person.has_key?(:Name)
#     puts Person.value?("CHirag Agrawal")
    
    
    
# Ranges 

# represent with 2 and three dot's i.e. 1..5 in which 1 to 5
# where both included and 1...5 here in three dot's 5 excluded
    
# to_a convert range of all elements into an array of a series

# range_array = (1..5).to_a
# puts range_array.inspect  # Outputs: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]




# Map method ***************************************************************************************


# hash = {
#     "key1": 1,
#     "key2": 2,
#     "key3": 3
# }


# transformed_hash = hash.map{ |key , value| [key , value*2]}.to_h        # to_h convert into an array

# puts transformed_hash

# How to Use Map with an Index?


# Cities = ["mumbai" , "delhi" , "kolkata"]

# IndexCities = Cities.map.with_index {|item , index| "#{item} , #{index}"}

# puts IndexCities

# shorthand notations used to convert each values into string

# numbers = [1, 4, 7]


# str_num = numbers.map(&:to_s)

# print str_num                             #["1", "4", "7"]



# Map vs each method


# The map and each method are both used to traverse collections in Ruby, but they have different purposes.

# Each method simply iterates over a collection and operates on each element. The return value of each method is the original collection.

# The map method, on the other hand, iterates over a collection and transforms each element of the collection using a block of code. The return value of the map method is a new collection with the transformed data.




# arr = ["scaler", "academy", "interview bit"]

# a = arr.each { |element| element.capitalize }
# puts a     # ["scaler", "academy", "interviewbit"]

# b = arr.map { |element| element.capitalize }
# puts b     # ["Scaler", "Academy", "Interviewbit"]




# one more e.g

# arr = [1, 2, 3]
# squared = arr.map { |n| n * n }
# puts squared.inspect  # Outputs: [1, 4, 9]




# # Methods Ending with a Question Mark (?)**************************************************

# Methods that end with a question mark (?) are typically used to indicate that the method 
# returns a boolean value (true or false). These methods are often used to check a condition or 
# query the state of an object.


# class User
#   attr_accessor :age

#   def initialize(age)
#     @age = age
#   end

#   def adult?
#     @age >= 18
#   end
# end

# user = User.new(20)
# puts user.adult?  # Output: true

# user = User.new(15)
# puts user.adult?  # Output: false


# Methods Ending with an Exclamation Mark (!)*****************************************************

# Methods that end with an exclamation mark (!) are conventionally used to indicate that the 
# method performs some kind of "dangerous" or potentially surprising operation. 
# This could mean that the method modifies the object it is called on, or it could raise an 
# exception if something goes wrong.

# name = "hello"

# # Non-dangerous method
# name.capitalize  # Returns "Hello" but does not modify the original string
# puts name        # Output: "hello"

# # Dangerous method
# name.capitalize! # Modifies the original string
# puts name        # Output: "Hello"




# case statement in ror ******************************************************************************

# its just like a switch statement of other language
